Please do not add subjective tags such as "fast" or "easy". Tags are meant to relate to the design of the language and its implementation. 

##### compiled
A compiled language is one whose main (or proposed) implementation is a compiler, that is, it takes in source code and emits a lower-level representation.

##### concurrent

##### first-class functions
This refers to languages that have first class functions, i.e. functions can be used as variables, passed around, and given as arguments to functions.

##### first-class types
This refers to languages that have first class types i.e. types can be used as variables, passed around, and given as arguments to functions.

##### logic
This is quite vague...
I assume it refers to languages have have control flow logic like ifs, else, and while.

##### parallel

##### pure
This refers to a purely functional programming language.

##### strong types
This refers to a language that uses strong typing, that is, it enforces strict rules about types, preventing errors that could result from discrepancies in types.

##### static types
This refers to a programming language that uses a system where variable types are determined at compile time and remain fixed during execution.
